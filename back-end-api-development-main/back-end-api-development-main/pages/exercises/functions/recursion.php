            <li>An old school problem!</li>

            <li>Hans has inherited â‚¬100,000. He can give his money to the bank at an interest rate of 8%. If he does, he is obliged to leave his money in the bank for 10 years. Hans wants to know how much money he will have left after 10 years.</li>

            <li>Use a recursive function to calculate how much money Hans will have left after 10 years</li>

            <li>Also make sure that Hans can see how much his money is worth after each year. Round all numbers down.</li>
