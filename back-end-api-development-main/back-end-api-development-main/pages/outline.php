		<h1>Outline</h1>

		<p>This is the entire Back End API development course. Everything you need to know will be put here.</p>

		<p>It relies entirely on Git, which is a version management system. It is expected that you know how to work with Git.</p>

		<p>The main repo is located at <a href="https://github.com/pascal-tm/back-end-api-development">https://github.com/pascal-tm/back-end-api-development</a> and should be cloned to your local machine</p>

		<p>The course will change throughout the semester. Things will be added, corrected, changed. This means you need to make sure the repository on your local machine has the latest version. This means doing a <code>git pull</code> regularly.</p>


		<h2>Structure</h2>

		<h3>Outline</h3>
		<p>Describes how the course material is structured and where you can find everything</p>

		<h3>Slides</h3>
		<p>Link to the slides which is your guide on how to master PHP. These will be updated automatically if anything changes.</p>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<p>Throughout the slides examples are mentioned. These examples are meant to be run through the PHP server so you can see the results. It is also possible to play with these examples and make changes to get to know PHP better. You can find these files on the following location:<code>/pages/examples</code> in the folder of the repository.</p>
		
		<h3>Exercises</h3>
		<p>After every chapter or important block of information there are also exercises. The solution to these exercises need to be put in a separate repository and linked to this repository. Intructions on how to do this will follow (TODO).</p>
		
		<p>These exercises have <i>extras</i> which are highly recommended, but not required.</p>

		<p>The solution is already provided in the <code>/pages/exercises/name-of-the-exercise/solution</code> folder. This is to enable you to use it as a hint if you don't know how to proceed. This doesn't mean you should copy paste the solutions verbatim. You still need to write your own code. There are multiple ways to do things in programming, each with their pros and cons. You need to show that you tried to find your own way. Only experience will teach you what is good and what is better</p>


		<h2>Scripts</h2>
		<p>In the <code>/scripts</code> folder of this repository there are some scripts. These are executables which will automate the installation of certain packages or run the PHP server. These can make your life easier, but are not required to use. It is still expected that you can understand what these scripts do and also that you can run these steps manually. This means getting acquainted with the <i>command line</i></p>
